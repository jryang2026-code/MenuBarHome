# `swift test` with a stall watchdog for the macOS CI runner.
#
# A deadlocked test can suspend a checked continuation forever: the suite time limit records an
# issue but cannot resume the continuation, so the job sits silent until its 45-minute timeout.
# After SWIFT_TEST_STALL_SECONDS without new output this script samples every swiftpm-testing
# process (Swift stacks) into the job log. It fails the step only when that log has no passing
# summary. A suite that already printed one and then hung at exit is a pass.
#
# Success is decided by Swift Testing's own summary line, never by the exit code or by the
# watchdog. A passing run can fail to exit on macos-26 (SwiftPM #8394), and `script` does not
# reliably forward the child status. A run with no summary line is a failure.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/ci_swift_test.sh [swift test arguments...]
